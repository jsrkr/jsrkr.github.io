## About Me

I am PhD candidate in Economics at American University, Washington, DC. My research interests lie in applied economics, with a focus on labor economics, development economics and public policy. In my research, I use econometric methods to analyze how telework exposure, digital infrastructure impact women empowerment. I also study how armed conflicts and extreme weather events influence labor market outcomes.
