# Jheelum Sarkar

## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at American University, Washington, DC. My research interests lie in applied economics, with a focus on Labor, Gender and Development such as labor supply, digital inclusion, telework and women's wellbeing. Another body of my research focuses on environment, inequality and labor market. I combine applied econometrics and machine learning models in my analyses.
